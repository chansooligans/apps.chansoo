Culture is the shared characteristics of a group of people, 
which encompasses , place of birth, religion, language, 
cuisine, social behaviors, art, literature, and music. Some 
cultures are widespread, and have a large number of people 
who associate themselves with those particular values, beliefs, 
and origins. Others are relatively small, with only a small 
number of people who associate themselves with that culture. 
However, the value of culture cannot be defined by its size. 
No matter if a culture is widespread or kept within a small 
region, is young or old, or has changed over time or stayed 
the same, every culture can teach us about ourselves, others, 
and the global community.
